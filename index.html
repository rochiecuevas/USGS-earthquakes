            <h3>Today's Earthquakes</h3>

            <p>An earthquake is a sudden shaking of the ground caused by sudden movement on a faultline. The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) Earthquakes Hazards Programme provides <a href = "https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/">real-time data about earthquakes</a>. <b>Today's Earthquakes</b> collects data from USGS (which is updated every five minutes) and maps them to visualise the locations of these earthquakes and inform the public about their magnitudes, significance, and depth.</p>

            <p>Each circle corresponds to an earthquake. The size of the circle and its colour indicates its magnitude. An earthquake's <a href = "https://earthquake.usgs.gov/learn/topics/mag_vs_int.php">magnitude</a>, or the measure of the energy released during an earthquake, ranges from 1 to <a href = "https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/browse/largest-world.php">more than 9</a>. Use the legend at the bottom right to see the colours corresponding to different earthquake magnitudes. Also, click on the different circles to find more information about them.</p>

            <p>To see the earthquakes in satellite view or in street map view, just choose the map view type from the options in the upper right hand box. </p>
